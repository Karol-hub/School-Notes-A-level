Feel free to change the parameters and look at how the building changes, changing the parameters may cause blender to freeze as it needs to do a significant amount of processing, if this happens wait for the program to respond, or restart it.

- Scroll wheel allows you to zoom in and out.
- Shift + middle mouse button allows you to move the camera, though this isn't needed to look at the building it can be useful. 
- Selecting an object and pressing the ./del key on a numpad will focus the camera to it.
