- Low level of radiation, mostly from natural sources
- Measured with GM (Geiger-Muller) tube
- Usually in the range of 0.2-0.5 counts per second
- Counts per second is Bequerel (Bq)
# Measuring it
[[CP 15 - Investigate the Absorption of Gamma Radiation by Lead]]
- Apparatus:
	- GM tube
	- Geiger counter
	- stopwatch
- Make sure there aren't any radiation sources in room
- Measure counts over large time frame and take repeat readings
- Use that to find average counts per second
