- Atomicity
	- A transaction must be processed in it's entirety or not at all
- Consistency
	- A transaction must maintain the referential integrity rules between linked tables
- Isolation
	- Simultaneous executions of transactions should lead to the same result as if they were executed one after the other (they are independent of each other)
- Durability
	- Once a transaction has been executed it will remain so regardless of the circumstances, such as in the event of a power cut.
