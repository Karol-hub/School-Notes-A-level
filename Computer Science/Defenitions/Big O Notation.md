Descries relationship between time taken to compute and number of items being processed

- Looks at how long an algorithm takes in the worst case scenario
- An O is used as prefix for all expressions written in big O notation
- n is used to refer to the number of items

2 Rules:
- Remove any constants
- Remove all terms except the one with the largest factor/exponent

Order of complexity:
Best performance
- [[O(1) Constant Complexity]]
- [[O(Log n) Logarithmic Complexity]]
- [[O(n) Linear Complexity]]
- [[O(n^k) Polynomial Complexity]]
- [[O(k^n) Exponential Complexity]]
Worst performance
