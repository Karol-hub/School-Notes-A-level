-  Iterated from left to right and repeatedly does this through every pass
- Works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
- This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets
- Worst-case time complexity is quite high.

- *Total no. of passes: n-1
- *Total no. of comparisons: n*(n-1)/2 = (n^2 - n)/2
