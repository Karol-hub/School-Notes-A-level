Reading floating points
With 2’s compliment In this case we have 4-bit mantissa with a 3-bit exponent 
![[Floating point binary example.png]]
= (½ + ¼) * 2^ (-4+1) = 0.09375

or 

![[Floating point bin moving.png]]
Now we have 1/16 + 1/32 = 0.09375 

Both methods give same results

[[Binary Normalisation|Normalisation]] Needs to occur for consistency

Addition and subtraction is same as normal [[Binary Addition]] you just need to make sure that the exponents are the same for both number or expand the number out fully
