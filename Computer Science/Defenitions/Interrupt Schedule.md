- Happens at the end of each [[Fetch Decode Execute cycle (FDE Cycle)]]
- If priority of current process < priority of content of interrupt register
- False
	- Next [[Fetch Decode Execute cycle (FDE Cycle)|FDE cycle]] continues
- True
	- Content of current [[Registers|registers]] are dumped into a [[Stack|stack]]
	- Appropriate Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is loaded into [[Main Memory|RAM]]
	- Flag is set to state an ISR has begun
	- Once the interrupts is serviced
	- Flag is reset 
- If priority of content interrupt register > priority of original content
- True
	- Another ISR begins
- False
	- Content of original instruction is returned from the stack and processes continue
