- A linked list can grow and shrink its size, as per the requirement. ([[Dynamic]])
- Nodes represent those data elements, and links or pointers connect each node. 
- Each node consists of two fields, the information stored in a linked list and a pointer that stores the address of its next node. 
- The last node contains null in its second field because it will point to no node. 
- It does not waste memory space.
