Adv| Dis
---|---
Cheaper to set up| Difficult to trace origin of files
Allows users to share resources| Backups must be performed separately
Easy to maintain| Poorer security (as any user can act as server and spread malicious code)
Not dependant on a central server (so it doesn't need to be maintained)| May be difficult to locate resources
