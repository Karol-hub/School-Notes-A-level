- Objects can behave differently depending on their class
- Can result in same [[Methods]] producing different outputs

Two categories:
- Overriding
	- Redefining a [[Methods|method]] in a class so that it functions differently
	- Produces a different output
- Overloading
	- Passing in different parameters into a method
	- Produces different output
