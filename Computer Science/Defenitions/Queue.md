First in first out (FIFO)Â 
Enqueue
- add item to queue
Dequeue
- item is removed from queue

In a linear queue there are two pointers, one in the front of the list and one in the end

Leaves blank spaces in memory when items are removed

There are circular queues which attempt to solve this problem by looping around when the queue is full
![[Circular queue.png]]
it is harder to implement but it is more space efficient in memory

queue overflow
- item added to full queue
queue underflow
- item removed from empty queue

Priority queue allows items to jump the queue
