- Pick one item as pivot point
- Separate data into items greater than the pivot (to the right of the pivot point or in a new array) and items smaller than the pivot point (to the left of pivot point or in a new array)
- Repeat this with new arrays to the left/right of pivot point
- Each cycle tells us where the pivot point belongs in sorted array.
