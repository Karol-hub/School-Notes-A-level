- Each job is given an equal section of processor time, known as a time slice
- Once each job in the [[Queue|queue]] has used their time slice another time slice is assigned for each job
- Cycle continues until a job is finished and it's removed from the [[Queue|queue]] 
- Longer jobs will take longer to execute as their execution is inefficiently split up
- Doesn't account for [[Interrupt Schedule|priority]] of jobs
