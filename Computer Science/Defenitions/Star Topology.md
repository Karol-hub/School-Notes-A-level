- [[Networks|Physical network topology]]
- ![[Star Topology demo.png]]
- Use a central node (often [[Switch]])
- [[MAC addresses]] are used to identify each device on the network

Adv| Dis
---|---
Performance isn't affected by traffic (because of the switch)| Expensive to set up because switch and cabeling
If one cable fails only that terminal is affected| If switch fails the entire network fails
Performance is better than [[Bus Topology]]| 
Easy to add new terminals|
No data collisions (more secure as other people on the network can't see data transmitted)|
