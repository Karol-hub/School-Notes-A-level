Thread - constant instructions being sent from a program to a [[CPU]]

- A single core can handle multiple threads
- Each program can make a thread where it sends instructions to the [[CPU]]
- [[CPU]] will alternate between threads to make it seem like they are all being executed at once
- Aims to reduce CPU idle time
- Constantly feeds instructions to the [[CPU]]
