Made to protect people intellectual property of an individual. If a work is original, copyright automatically applies and doesn’t expire until 25-70 years after the death of the creator, depending on the type of work. 

In 1992 the act was extended to computer programs as a type of literary work, meaning copyright automatically applies to code 

If an individual believes their work is being copied, it is their responsibility to take action under this act.
