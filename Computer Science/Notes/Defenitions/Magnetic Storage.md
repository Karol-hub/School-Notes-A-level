Represents binary information with two states 
- Polarised
	- All magnetic fields align and magnetic field can be read
- Unpolarised
	- Magnetic fields are random and gives a different reading

## Hard Drive Disk (HDD)
- Rotate a magnetic disk at high speeds
- Read with an actuating arm
- Allows any part of the disk to be accessed 

Adv
- More space efficient than Magnetic Tape and floppy disks
Dis
- Slow read/write speeds
- Moving parts make it degrade over time and be more delicate

## Magnetic Tape 
- Long stretch of tape which can be polarised or not
- Not very Space efficient
- Used in VHS tapes

## Floppy Disks
- Thin magnetic disk
- Encased in plastic so it doesn't get dusty
- Low capacity
- Portable
