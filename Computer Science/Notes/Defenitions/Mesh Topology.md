- Every node is connected to every other node
- Most common in wireless technology

Adv| Dis
---|---
If using a wireless network there is no wire cost| If not using a wireless network wire is expensive
As number of nodes increases so does reliability and speed| If using a wireless network each node must have wireless capability ([[Wireless Access Point (WAP)]]) which can be expensive
Nodes are automatically incorporated| Maintenance is difficult
Data doesn't go through a switch so it's faster|
