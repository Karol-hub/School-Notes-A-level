- To get from one term to the next we multiply by the same number each time (common ratio)
- Common ratio is represented with $r$
# Formula
$$u_{n}=a * r^{n-1}$$

| Symbol | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| $u_{n}$ | The n'th term of the sequence |
| $a$ | First term of the sequence |
| $r$ | Common ration |
| $n$ | Which term in the sequence it is |
## Proof
$$a, ar, ar^{2},ar^{3},...,ar^{n-1}$$
multiplied by $(n-1)$ lots of $r$ each time
