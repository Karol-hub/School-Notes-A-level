Assumptions (the gas is an [[Ideal Gasses|Ideal gas]])

- The duration of collisions is negligible in comparison to time between collisions
- The motion of molecules in random, and they experience perfectly elastic collisions
- The motion of the molecules follows Newtonâ€™s laws
- The molecules move in straight lines between collisions
