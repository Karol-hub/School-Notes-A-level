Serves: 8
# Ingredients
- 2 cups mashed very ripe banana, about 4 large
- ½ cup cane sugar
- ½ cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pan
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- Variations (choose to add one of these)
	- ½ cup chopped walnuts, plus 2 tablespoons for topping
	- Chopped pecans
	- Chocolate chips
	- Dried cranberries
	- Raisins

# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C and grease an 8x4 or 9x5-inch loaf pan. 
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed banana, sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. 
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Don’t overmix. Fold in the ½ cup walnuts/variation. 
5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and top with the remaining 2 tablespoons walnuts/variation.
6. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean and the top springs back to the touch. I like to check the loaf after 40 minutes. If the top is golden brown, I cover it with foil for the remaining bake time to prevent further browning.

# Tips
- If you come up short on the banana, with 1 ½ or 1 ¾ cups mashed, substitute Greek yogurt or sour cream for the missing quantity to keep the loaf moist.
- Thawed/frozen bananas work well here.
