# Ingredients
- 4 tablespoons ground flaxseed + 4 tablespoons warm water* (or 2 eggs)
- 1¾ cups whole-wheat pastry flour, (or white/wheat mix)
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ⅔ cup almond milk (or any type of milk)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- ⅓ cup maple syrup
- ⅓ cup olive oil or any neutral oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 cup mashed ripe banana, about 2 bananas
- ½ cup chocolate chips, optional

# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C and lightly grease or spray a 12-cup muffin tin.
2. In a small bowl, combine the flaxseed and warm water and set aside to thicken for 5 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. In a medium bowl, combine the almond milk, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, oil, and vanilla and stir to combine. Stir in the flaxseed mixture.
5. Add the wet ingredients to the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Do not overmix. Fold in the mashed banana and chocolate chips, if using. Use a ⅓ cup measuring scoop to divide the batter into the muffin tin.
6. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out almost clean. Let cool 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling.

# Tips
- The riper the bananas the better
- Don't overmix, just mix until ingredients are combined
