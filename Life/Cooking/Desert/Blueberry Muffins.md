# Ingredients
- ¾ cup + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the blueberries
- ¾ cup whole wheat flour
- ½ cup + 2 tablespoons almond flour
- 1 tablespoon aluminium-free baking powder
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup cane sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon lemon oil, optional
- 1 ¼ cups fresh blueberries
# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C and grease a 12-cup muffin tin. 
2. In a medium bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together the almond milk, olive oil, eggs, sugar, vanilla, and lemon oil, if using.
4. Dust the blueberries with ½ teaspoon flour and toss to lightly coat them. This will prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the muffin cups.
5. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and stir to combine. Gently fold in the blueberries. Use a ⅓-cup measuring cup to scoop the batter into the muffin cups. Bake for 17 to 20 minutes, or until the muffin tops spring back to the touch.
6. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the muffins. Remove from the pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

# Tips
- Toss the blueberries with a pinch of flour before folding into batter
- Don't overmix, mix only until ingredients are combined
- Add lemon oil/lemon zest
