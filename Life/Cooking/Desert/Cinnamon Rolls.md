# Ingredients
# For the yeast
- ½ cup warm water, 110°
- 1 (10-30g) package active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon cane sugar
## Dough
- ⅓ cup melted coconut oil, plus more for brushing
- ½ cup almond milk, at room temperature
- ⅓ cup cane sugar
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 2¾ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading
## Filling
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 1½ tablespoons cinnamon
## Glaze
- 1½ cups powdered sugar, sifted
- 3 to 4 tablespoons almond milk
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

# Instructions
1. Grease an 8x11 or 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. In a small bowl, stir together the water, yeast, and sugar. Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy. 
3. Make the dough: In a medium bowl, combine the coconut oil, almond milk, sugar, and salt. Stir in the yeast mixture. Place the flour in a large bowl, then add the wet ingredients and stir until combined. The mixture will be sticky. Use your hands to roughly knead the mixture, then turn it out onto a floured surface. Knead 3 to 4 minutes until smooth, sprinkle with more flour if needed, and form into a ball. 
4. Brush a large bowl with coconut oil and place the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Make the filling: In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon.
6. Punch down dough and roll out on a floured surface into a 20x14-inch rectangle. Brush with 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar to within ½ inch of the edges.
7. Starting at one of the short 14-inch ends, roll tightly into a log, then slice into 12 rolls. Place the rolls into the baking dish cut-side up, cover, and let rise for 1 hour.
8. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
9. Make the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons almond milk, and vanilla until smooth. If it’s too thick, add more almond milk.
10. Bake the rolls 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly golden on top. Remove and allow to cool for 10 minutes, then drizzle the glaze on top and serve.
