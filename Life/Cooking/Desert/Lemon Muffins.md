# Ingredients
- 1 cup Almond Milk
- 1 teaspoon Apple Cider Vinegar
- 1¾ cups All Purpose Flour
- ½ cup almond flour
- 2½ teaspoons Baking Powder
- ¼ teaspoon Baking Soda
- ½ teaspoon Salt
- ½ cup + 2 tablespoons Sugar
- ⅓ cup Virgin Olive Oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon zest
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract
- 1 tablespoon Chia Seeds, more for garnish
## Glaze
- ½ cup Vegan Cream Cheese
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons Maple Syrup
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest, more for garnish
# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C and lightly oil a 12-cup non-stick muffin tin.
2. In a small bowl, combine the almond milk and apple cider vinegar. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla. Stir in the almond milk mixture. Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the chia seeds and use a ⅓-cup measuring cup to scoop the batter into the muffin tins. 
5. Bake for 16 to 17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.
6. Make the glaze. Using a hand mixer or a food processor, mix the cream cheese, lemon juice, maple syrup, and lemon zest until smooth. Dollop onto the cooled muffins and garnish with chia seeds and lemon zest.
# Tips
- Make your own almond flour by blending slivered almonds in a blender until they become a fine meal.
