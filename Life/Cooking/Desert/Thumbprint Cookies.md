# Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned and levelled)
- 1 cup almond flour (spooned and levelled)
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temp
- ½ cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract
- ½ cup raspberry and/or apricot jam
# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours and salt.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter, sugar, vanilla, and almond extract until fluffy. Gradually add the flour and mix until combined.
4. Scoop rounded tablespoons of the dough, roll into balls, and place on the prepared baking sheets. Gently press down to form disks and use your thumb, or the back of a 1 teaspoon measuring spoon, to make an indentation in the middle of the cookies. Spoon ½ teaspoon of jam onto each cookie.
5. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
# Tips
- Plan ahead for room temp butter and place it out a few hours before starting to cook
- Press down with the back of a teaspoon/measuring spoon
- Think about the jam: cookie ratio
	- 1/2 teaspoon of jam works god for small ones
