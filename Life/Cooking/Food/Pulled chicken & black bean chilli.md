# Ingredients
- 2 tbsp sunflower oil
- 2 onions, sliced
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp oregano
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 3 tbsp chipotle in adobo or 1 tsp chipotle paste
- 350g passata
- 1⁄2 chicken stock shot or cube
- 400g can black beans, drained but not rinsed
- 1⁄2 lime, juiced
- cooked rice or tortillas, coriander, feta, lime wedges and chopped red onion, to serve (optional)
# Instructions
1. Heat the oil in a shallow saucepan or casserole dish with a lid. Tip in the onions and cook over a medium-low heat for 5 mins until softened. Add the chicken and turn up the heat to medium. Stir in the garlic, a small pinch of sugar, the oregano, cumin seeds and some seasoning. Cook for a couple of minutes, then add the chipotle and cook for a few minutes more. Pour in the passata, 100ml water and add the stock. Season and bring to a simmer.
2. Cover with a lid and cook for 40-50 mins, stirring occasionally until the chicken is tender. Shred the chicken into the sauce using two forks, then stir through the beans. Simmer for 5 mins more, then turn off the heat. Squeeze in the lime juice. _Can be kept chilled for three days and frozen for up to two months_. Defrost thoroughly and reheat. Serve with rice or tortilla wraps, and some coriander, feta, lime wedges and red onion on the side, if you like.
