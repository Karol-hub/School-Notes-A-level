# Ingredients
- 1 l chicken stock
- 4 salmon fillets
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 50g butter
- 1 onion, very finely diced
- 1 garlic clove, crushed or finely grated
- 250g Arborio rice
- 300ml white wine
- 100g frozen peas
- ½ lemon, juiced and zested
- 50g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve
# Instructions
1. Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a saucepan over a medium heat, add the salmon fillets and poach for 6 mins or until just cooked. Remove from the pan, leaving the stock behind, and set aside to cool for 2-3 mins before removing the skin. Keep on a low heat or remove and leave the lid on to keep the stock as warm as possible.
2. Heat the oil and half the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-low heat and, once the butter has melted, scatter in the onion and cook for 10-12 mins until softened but not golden. Add the garlic, stir and cook for 1 min before stirring in the rice and cooking for 2 mins until well coated in the oil.
3. Pour in the wine, turn up the heat to medium, and cook for 4-5 mins until evaporated. Keep the pan on the heat and pour in about a quarter of the reserved chicken stock. Stirring often until the stock has been absorbed by the rice, about 4-5 mins. Repeat three more times, adding the next batch once the previous one has been absorbed. With the final batch, add the peas and flake in the cooked salmon fillets. Season with lots of freshly ground black pepper and cook for 3-4 mins until the rice is tender and the peas and salmon are heated through. If the rice needs a little more cooking or the stock absorbs too quickly, add a splash more hot water.
4. Remove the risotto from the heat and stir through the remaining butter, lemon juice and parmesan. Scatter over the lemon zest, if you like, then serve straightaway.
