# Ingredients
- 1 tbsp rapeseed oil
- 500g turkey thigh mince (7% fat)
- 2 large garlic cloves, finely grated
- 1 chilli, deseeded and chopped
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 500g carton passata
- 2 x 400g cans red kidney beans drained (liquid reserved)
- 2 tsp vegetable bouillon powder
- 2 red peppers, deseeded and diced
- 4 small sweet potatoes (about 140g each)
- 2 avocados
- 1 lime, juiced
# Instruction
1. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat, then tip in the mince and break it up using a wooden spoon. Stir in the garlic and chilli, and cook for 10 mins until the mince is cooked through. Add the herbs and spices, and cook for a minute more.
2. Pour in the passata, the reserved liquid from the beans, the bouillon powder and peppers. Cover and cook for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened. Tip in the beans and cook for 3-5 mins more.
3. Meanwhile, prick two of the sweet potatoes all over using a fork, then microwave on high for 7-10 mins until tender. Mash one of the avocados with half the lime juice in a small bowl.
4. To serve, halve the potatoes and spoon over half the chilli, then finish with the mashed avocado. Chill the remainder for another day. 
- _The chilli will keep covered and chilled for four days or frozen for three months. Reheat in a microwave or pan over low heat until piping hot. Serve with the remaining sweet potatoes and mashed avocado and lime juice, as described above_.
