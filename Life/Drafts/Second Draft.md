On top of the A-levels I am studying I have completed an EPQ project where I was able to decide my own goal and work towards it over the course of a year. I taught me a lot about time and project management. I decided to keep organised from the start because I knew it would help me in the future. The research I did made the problem solving seem a lot easier as I could apply the skills I saw in other people's work to my own problem. I had to do a lot of documentation for this project, which I never did before. But I had focused heavily on organisation at the start so this process was going smoothly once I got in a routine. It also allowed me to see the importance of documentation as it was my strongest resource when it came to report writing.

I also undertook another project in engineering called the EDT Gold award where a small group from my class worked on a real life problem presented by Cummins, I was grateful for this as it allowed me an insight of a career in engineering. I enjoyed the project as it challenged my problem solving skills and forced me to apply the knowledge that I gained in school to a real life scenario. My role was mainly to create visualisations of the concept ideas and any other supporting images, this gave me a lot of experience with CAD and I had an advantage in CAD modelling as my EPQ project used the same CAD software and gave me more experience. The main difference is the level or precision I needed to accomplish since for my EPQ I could just roughly guess everything whereas in this project I needed to be exact which was a big change for me which I had to adapt to.

Outside of school I also do a lot of sports, such as volleyball which has taught me a lot about teamwork as I am relying on my team to support me, however still ready to cover for them in case something happens. I have been regularly attending training sessions for over a year now and I can see my improvements, which makes the hard work worth it. It taught me a lot about discipline since it was a regular commitment and I couldn't let myself become unreliable for other team members.
More recently I also picked up Tae Kwando (TKD) which also strengthened my discipline and also challenged my time management as I had to juggle training and studying. Though I am only yellow belt, I spar with the black belts because of the weight group difference. Since I am going up against more talented individuals I often get beaten, which challenged and strengthened my resilience, but TKD helped me realise that I need to get up and give it another attempt no matter how hopeless it seems. But I always try to figure out why I made that mistake and how I can improve because people there know how to land a hit so I need to avoid getting hit as much as possible. I found this skill very useful as it forces me to think of new ways around a problem rather than just doing the same thing over and over without any result.

I also work as a part time tutor mainly focusing on mathematics, this challenged my maths skills as I had to know the basics inside out to be able to explain them in a way that the student can understand.

For my work experience I managed to land a place at Cummins thanks to the employee I met as part of my EDT project. During my week there I was able to experience the environment of an engineering company. At this point I was still contemplating between computer science and engineering, but when I was given a problem to solve as part of an exercise I was able to optimise my design to it's fullest potential thanks to computer science, as I wrote a script to find the optimal dimensions. This helped me realise that I don't need to abandon computer science and I can implement it while engineering to create better solutions. The person supervising me seemed surprised at this idea, so I realised it's something I can bring to the industry and use to solve problems in more efficient ways.
