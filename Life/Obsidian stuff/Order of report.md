# Title page
This should include the title of the report (which should give a precise indication of the subject matter), the author(s)’s name(s), module, and the date.
# Acknowledgements
You should acknowledge any help you have received in collecting the information for the report, for example from staff in your department, support services or external companies.
# Contents
You should list all the main sections of the report in sequence with the page numbers they begin on. If there are charts, diagrams or tables included in your report, these should be listed separately under a title such as ‘List of Illustrations’ together with the page numbers on which they appear.
# Abstract or executive summary
This should be a short paragraph summarising the main contents of the report. It should include a short statement of the main task, the methods used, conclusions reached and any recommendations made. The abstract or summary should be concise, informative and independent of the report. The summary may have more than one purpose: it reminds the reader what they have read but it is also useful to busy managers or professors who may not always read the full report. Write this section after you have written the main body of the report.
# Introduction
This should give the context and scope of the report and should include your terms of reference (what have you been asked to find out?) State your objectives clearly, define the limits of the report, outline the method of enquiry, give a brief general background to the subject of the report e.g. the company or procedure, and indicate the proposed development.
# Methodology
In this section you should state how you carried out your enquiry. What form did your enquiry take? Did you carry out interviews or questionnaires, how did you collect your data? What measurements did you make? How did you choose the subjects for your interviews?
# Results or findings
Present your findings in as simple a way as possible. The more complicated the information looks, the more difficult it will be to interpret. Graphs, charts and diagrams help your reader identify key results and will break the flow of written text.
# Discussion
This is the section where you analyse and interpret your results drawing from the information which you have collected, explaining its significance. Identify important issues and suggest explanations for your findings. Outline any problems encountered and try and present a balanced view
# Conclusions and recommendations
This is the section of the report which draws together the main issues. It should be expressed clearly and should not present any new information. You may wish to list your recommendations in a separate section or include them with the conclusions.
# References
It is important that you give precise and accurate details of all the work by other authors which has been referred to within the report. References are normally listed in alphabetical order by the authors' names or in numerical order. Check your Department handbook to find out what referencing format is required by your Department.
# Appendices
An appendix contains additional related information which is not essential to read but can be consulted if the reader wishes. However, the interpretation of the report should not depend on this being read. You could include details of interview questions, statistical data, a glossary of terms, or other such information.
