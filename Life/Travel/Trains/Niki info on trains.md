Comparison between West midlands trains and Avanti west Coast ![ðŸš‰](https://discord.com/assets/61cec822f6697dee4e983546ebdd8b63.svg)![ðŸš†](https://discord.com/assets/654296028cc95c58b0f583ab5a61327b.svg) (warning: my own personal opinion)
    - The ways the interior feels much more human and lively. This is because the exits being in the middle of coaches instead of at the ends, and because of usually more sunlight, along with some more design choices. This can be both a good or a bad thing depending on person.
    - Due to west coast being less popular, it is usually less crowded, meaning most of the time you won't have to share your seat with other people
    - On west midlands, the corridor between rows of seats is bigger, meaning it is easier to travel through the trains without trouble. This does though mean the size of seats is smaller than on Avanti
    - West midlands has 2 types of coaches, one with bigger seats, arm rests and tables, and the other without those. This means you usually have to guess at which end of platform you have to stand on and causes annoyance.
    
Points about Avanti from now on
    - Faster and Cheaper. This does though mean the trains are almost always full. On the other hand, West midlands rarely have this problem.
    - The gap between the windows and the train is wide and high enough to lean on comfortably, allowing for a quick nap. A major advantage avanti has over west midlands
    - Seats are much more bigger on avanti trains, giving you much more personal space.
    - avanti has triple seats, for those who travel in large groups. (West midlands has those as well on the bad coaches)
    - Avanti looks much more aesthetically pleasing from the outside
    - The corridor between seats on Avanti is much more tighter, making it uncomfortable to get around and making it more likely to bump into people sitting.

Conclusion: Considering I travel to and from Birmingham New Street and Rugby, I find it much more preferable to travel on west midlands. Not only because it matches my schedule (both to and from), but because I find them better overall. Personally, I enjoy the more human feel of the the design of the trains. Getting on the good coaches isn't a problem from me as well, as I have memorised where to stand to get on them, and even if I don't, there is rarely other person sitting on the same seat as me. Cost and speed are also not a problem for me, as travelling on west midlands only costs a few more pennies and 10 extra minutes. I rarely travel not alone and never with more than 3 people, so more the triple seats that Avanti coast offers aren't that appealing to me.

one important thing to note though is that west midland did get more crowded since then, but still not as much Avanti
