- The ability for software to replicate human intelligence 

Expert system / knowledge-based system 
- Replicate the knowledge an expert would have in a field 
- Made from knowledge base which consist of facts and rules, this is interrogated to form a diagnosis 

Neural networks 
- Can learn from sets of data 
- Can apply what they have learn to a unique data set 
- Can detect tiny inconstancies within data sets 


Concerns with AI replacing people in the workplace and leaving people jobless 

Common within smart home systems in voice recognition systems, however this is controversial as some people believe they could be spied upon. 

Leaves questions for accountability if the AI makes a catastrophic mistake. 

If AI ever achieves sentience, what rights should it have?
# General statement for questions
## [[Moral]]
- 
## [[1.5.1 Computing related legislation|Legal]]
- [[Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988|Copyright]], since the AI needs to be trained on data that may be copyrighted
- [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection]], AI outputs personal data from data set it trained on, e.g. names, email.
## [[Ethical]]
- Digital divide, not everyone has access to AI tools, putting them at a disadvantage
- Anyone reading AI work won't be able to tell if it's a human or AI's work.
	- e.g. Examiners can't assess student's work because it could be AI
	- Plagiarises other people's work from the data set it trained on
## [[Environmental Effects|Environmental]]
- 
## Economic
- Device labour is cheaper than human labour
- Machines can be more efficient
## Social
- 
## Cultural
- No more human culture, replaced with AI
