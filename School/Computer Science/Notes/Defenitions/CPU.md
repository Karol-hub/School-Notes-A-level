It's a component in a computer
Allows A machine to process data using its components:
- [[ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit)]]
- [[Control Unit (CU)]] 
- [[Registers]]
- [[Busses]]

## Functions
- [[Assembly Language]] can be used to tell the CPU what to do
- [[Fetch Decode Execute cycle (FDE Cycle)]] happens every clock signal
- [[Pipelining]] can be used to make the CPU more efficient
- Jobs are [[Scheduling|scheduled]] to ensure all data is processed

## Factors affecting CPU performance
- [[Clock]]
- [[Multi Core Processing|Number of Cores]]
- [[Cache Memory|Amount of cache memory]]

## Architecture
- [[Harvard Architecture|Harvard]]
- [[Von Neumann Architecture|Von Neumann]]
- [[Contemporary]]
