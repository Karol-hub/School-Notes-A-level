when one process is finished another immediately begins the next instruction

Pros| Cons
---|---
Increased program throughput – number of tasks completed in an amount of time is greater| If there is a large amount of uses trying to run a task these programs will take longer to compute as they must wait to use the processor
Time that would be wated by the processor waiting for the user to input data or look at output is used on another task |
