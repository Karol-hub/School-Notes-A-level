Problem is continually broken down into smaller problems until each subproblem can be solved as a self-contained subroutine.

- Aims to reduce the complexity of the problem.
- Can result in using pre-coded modules or libraries which saves time and would otherwise be coded and tested
- Aims to make it easier to manage as different teams can tackle different problems allowing them to be developed in parallel
- Makes it easier to debug as bugs are easier to identify in smaller modules.
