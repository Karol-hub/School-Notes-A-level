- Makes use of semiconductors forming logic gates
	- NOR is used for small files
	- NAND is used for larger files
- Store electrical charge which can be read as binary data 
- Information is stored in blocks which are combined to make pages 
- More expensive /GB than other methods

## Solid State Drives (SSD)
- Small and portable 
- No moving parts (more durable)
- High Read/Write speeds
- Expensive
- Limited write cycles
