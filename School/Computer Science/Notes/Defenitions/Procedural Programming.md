| Versatility </br>- Applicable to a wide range or problems              | Prioritising operations over data </br>- values sequential functions and operations over actual data </br>- may not be the best paradigm for data sensitive materials |
| Simplicity of use </br> - Very beginner friendly </br>- Easier to test | Data exposure </br>- all data in the code is visible so it's not as secure as other paradigms                                                                         |
| Easy accessibility </br>- Many learning resources                           |                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Reusability </br>- Functions created can be reused in other sections                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                       |

4 main structures:
