- Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
- Smaller instruction set
- Each instruction is one line of [[Machine Code]] and takes one clock cycle
- More common in modern computers

[[RISC Processor]] | [[CISC Processor]]
--|--
Compiler has to do more work to translate code into machine code | Compiler has to do less work to translate code into machine code
More [[Main Memory\|RAM]] is required to store the code | Less [[Main Memory\|RAM]] is required to store code as code is shorter
[[Pipelining]] is possible as each instruction is one line | Many specialised instructions even though only a few are used (lots of bloat)
