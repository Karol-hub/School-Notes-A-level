Aims to get the best possible layout for a [[Relational Database]] 
Aims to accomplish:
- No redundancy (unnecessary duplicates)
- Consistent data throughout linked tables (data integrity)
- Records can be added and removed without issues
- Complex queries can be carried out

3 types:
**First Normal Form**
- Each entry is atomic (No attribute contains more than one value)
- No duplicate entries
**Second Normal Form**
- Is in First Normal Form
- Doesnâ€™t have any [[Partial Dependencies]]
**Third Normal Form**
- Needs to be in Second Normal Form
- Contains no [[Non-Key Dependencies]]
