# How successful I was
## How I judged success
- [ ] success criteria
- [ ] personal goals
## What did I achieve
- [ ] Some renders
- [ ] Geometry nodes 
## Performance based on expectations
- [ ] personal goals
- [ ] Did I achieve them
# Changes that occurred
- [ ] Talk about impact of all of these
- [ ] Changing project
- [ ] Grid method to procedural method
# Future development
- [ ] Geometry nodes knowledge will be useful
- [ ] Still continue to make things in blender as hobby
- [ ] Will use skills for other projects
- [ ] Might start another project which will be smaller in scale
# Support
- [ ] Online forms
- [ ] Blender documentation
# What would I do differently
- [ ] Time management 
- [ ] Have a more concrete plan when developing
- [ ] Do more research
	- [ ] Watch videos on topic even if they seem not useful since they can contain useful topics
	- [ ] Look at other projects and take not of how other people overcame their problems
