# What I enjoyed
This project allowed me to work more independently which was a nice change, as in all the other subjects that I took for A-levels there is a specification that I have to follow. This also allowed me to work at my own pace, not having to worry about falling behind in terms of work since I got to define how much work I have to do. The independence also meant problem solving was independent and knowing that I solved a problem by myself was very rewarding.
Even before the project started I was making scenes in blender as a hobby, being able to play a podcast in the background and work on the project was something that I looked forward to and was one of the more memorable ways of spending my time in the project.
# What I disliked
As much as I loved solving things on my own, that changed when I was trying to accomplish one thing for four hours without making any progress. Time management was definitely one of my weak points since I wasn't able to get into a steady routine and worked on the project when I had time, which often left in me neglecting the project. Documentation also felt like a chore since I had to stop what I am doing and record whatever I was doing, I felt like this broke my line of though so I often did it at the end of a session, but then I had to go back through everything and take screenshots.  
# Challenges I encountered
At the start of the project my operating system corrupted and I wasn't able to retrieve any of the files, at this point I didn't have a significant amount of progress and I also used it as an opportunity to change the focus of my project from animation to something that focuses on geometry nodes.
However I didn't have any prior experience with geometry nodes so I had to do a lot of research on geometry nodes and teach myself how to use them.
It also turned out that generating a house is a lot harder than I anticipated because blender lacked iteration, so I had to come up with unique solutions to the problems I encountered. 
# Skills I developed
There is a detailed description of how I developed my skills in the "Skills Audit" section so I won't go into detail in this section.
## How skills are transferred to other situations
These skills I can definitely be used in different scenarios as problem solving is a universal skill which I used a lot when working with geometry nodes and shader nodes. This type of thinking process is commonly used in STEM workplaces which is where I plan to start a career in.
Presenting is a universal skill that is used in every industry. I learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses while presenting and can focus on eliminating my weaknesses in future presentations.
The 3D modelling is already useful for other scenarios as I had to do some CAD modelling for another project that I undertook and I found it a lot easier due to the time I spent in this project. I also needed to create some assets for my computer science coursework, since I already had experience in 3D design this wasn't an issue.

# Working independently
Since I was in charge of my project I was in charge of my time management. Now that I am able to look at the whole project I realised that I should have dedicated time each week for the project to make sure that I am spending at least a couple of hours on the project.
I also had to research on my own about my own topic, this was difficult as there wasn't any dedicated resources I could check for guidance but needed to find someone with a similar problem and see how they tackled it, then apply that to my project and when I wasn't able to find anything that could help me I had to make my own methodology from scratch, I wasn't able to contact anyone more experienced than me. So I often had to figure things out by myself. 
There wasn't any set way of documentation so I had to come up with my own method and keep consistent, this was definitely a challenge at first but became bearable with time.
