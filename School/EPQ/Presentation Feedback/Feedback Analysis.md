# Feedback Analysis
## Previous Presentation
![[First presentation.png|Slides used in first presentation]]
### Details
The first presentation was only intended to be around 3 minutes so I created less slides, The main thing that I tried to focus on was the aesthetics of the slides and to make sure that I wasn't reading off the board since the audience is capable of that themselves so my thoughts were that I should be there expanding on whatever is on the slides which is why I decided to keep the text to a minimum.
### Feedback
I attempted to use a basic analogy to explain the concepts that I was covering. The feedback that I got told me that this helped the audience understand and it's definitely something that I will include in my next presentation.
I was also told that I went into too much technical detail and that the audience didn't understand everything that I was saying. This is definitely something that I will consider when rehearsing my next presentation.
My timing was over the 3 minutes which is something that I should have addressed while rehearsing and something that I will consider in the future.

## Final presentation
![[presenting.png]]
When I was making the presentation I was mainly focusing on showing the audience the process that I used to create a building while not really expanding on anything outside of my artefact and how it works. My aim was to create a presentation that was informative and engaging by my standards and experience with presentations.

I tried to focus on a couple of key points while making the slides, I started with the style and noticed that most of my images have a dark background which is why I chose a slide format with a dark grey background from https://slidesgo.com/ using a premade slide template allowed me to focus on the content more and have a high quality slide template without having to spend hours making it.
The next thing that I focused on was creating small plan where I tried to focus on introducing the content of the presentation in a way that I could explain each key topic without confusing the audience and making sure that every point is expanded upon so that the audience has a clear understanding. Because the previous presentation showed me that not everyone has the technical understanding that I do in this particular time.
The next step was to include images that would go along with the points I wanted to convey. I also tried to make the images interesting and worthy of focus from the audience, this was because I sat through many presentations where this wasn't considered and I often found myself spacing out during these presentations.
But I also didn't want to make the audience through constant reading since that also doesn't make a presentation engaging from my experience. Which is why I tried to keep the amount of text to a minimum with the reasoning, why should the audience read it when I can read and elaborate on it for them. Some of the sources I used for the project were also presentation at a conference, which is where I took a lot of my inspiration from.
I also tried to use as much analogies as possible as last time using an analogy worked so to explain the more complicated topics I used analogies which simplified the concept and allowed me to explain it in the time limit provided.
### Rehearsing the presentation
Since I didn't have any text I needed to be constantly speaking and explaining the images on the board so I wrote a couple of key points in the notes sections of each slide which I wanted to hit. I never gave myself a concrete script because I was making so many changes and I would have to memorise a long speech, which wouldn't have been an efficient use of time.
I also tried to rehearse with people so I got into a call with a friend and presented it to him. He gave me a lot of feedback on my presentation and recommended adding different analogies which helped expand on the topics covered. One of the key things that he added was a hypothetical scenario at the start which explained the target audience of the artefact and allowed me to introduce the project in a different way then anyone else, since everyone else started with a title page.
One thing that I wish I should have done was to present the presentation to people who were unfamiliar with the topic, though my friends topic was limited it still wouldn't give me an accurate replication of the audience on the day.
At this time my presentation was around 7mins 20seconds long. Which was just over the minimum length of 7 minuets. However I didn't have enough time to make any large changes that would increase the time by a significant amount.
### Impressions before and after presentation
I wasn't too stressed before the presentation as I rehearsed the presentation and spent long enough on the project to know that I was talking about. When I was presenting I tried not to stutter as from experience I knew that it breaks the tempo of the presentation. I also tried focusing on facing the audience and projecting my voice so that everyone can hear the presentation clearly.
I felt like I had answered the questions to the best of my abilities, however my presentation did end up running a bit short at 6mins 47seconds, this small time decrease could have been because I was talking slightly faster than usual due to my stress. In the future I would definitely make my presentation longer to compensate for this factor, but it wasn't an extreme amount so I would still count the presentation successful.

### Feedback from the audience

Shows that most of the points I was intending to cover were hit, however the feedback proves that there were some points to improve upon such as explaining how everything works in more detail as it would have taken up more time and lined up with my goals as well as explaining more about the actual documentation, skills, report and process that I had to use to make the project possible. After watching other people's presentations mine definitely stood out as I didn't include any of those points. However overall the audience seemed satisfied with the presentation.

The fact that most of the questions involved questions about the project rather than the artefact further reinforces the fact that I should have included parts about those things, but the feedback shows that the questions were well answered with enough detail as I tried to link a lot of the questions to the project and explained my reasoning behind the decisions I made, for example in the question "How successful has the project been in relation to your expectations" I answered along the lines of "My main goal was to develop my skills with geometry node so in that context I was very successful however I did set myself a larger goal that I wasn't able to achieve in the time limit provided", the audience member also seemed satisfied with the answer I provided as the feedback wasn't anything negative

## Final thoughts
Overall I would consider the presentation a success since I was able to achieve all of my goals since I was able to inform others on my artefact and how it works, I definitely feel more confident about public speaking after the presentation so I definitely developed my public speaking skills, which is something that I usually struggle with it so I am grateful for this experience and hope it can benefit me in the future
