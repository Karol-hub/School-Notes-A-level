# Skill overview
![[skills overview.png]]
This spreadsheet shows how the importance of each skill changed with each point in the project. At the start I hadn't developed any methodology so I wasn't sure how important it is to project since I was learning the skills which I have never used before.

As of the start of the project I was still unfamiliar with everything, and I wasn't sure of how important everything so the importance isn't that relevant I was just trying things out and looking for ways I can achieve my desired outcome. The key average proves that I was confident with 3D modelling and shader nodes as they were what I primarily used before the project and wanted to improve my skillset to not be limited to theses 2 aspects since the software that I am using is capable of so much more.

I became more aware of the techniques and how I can use them to my advantage. I was still note entirely sure of everything I need to do and don't have a method fully developed so the importance may change.
At this point I don't believe the average is a good measurement of the overall progress since some images are focused on one aspect (eg, geometry nodes) while not contributing anything to the other statistics, therefore the total should be used from this point onwards.
Since the total for UV unwrapping, texturing and geometry nodes all used to be zero but now I have

I adapted a different technique that would make UV unwrapping and texturing essentially useless but it's more efficient. It also allows me to focus on

# Beyond Hard skills
These aren't the only skills that I have developed since the project was a lot more than just the hard skills that were specified above, some of those soft skills that I gained include
- Public Speaking
	- I had not done much presentations before this so it was valuable experience that will help me with public speaking in the future.
- Organisation
	- This project was a lot larger than other side projects that I undertook before this so it was important to keep organised and not become a victim of my own bad practice.
- Documentation
	- This links in with organisation a lot because I had to keep my documentation organised so it would be easy to look back at it and write a report or find a source in case some part of the artefact was failing.
- Time management
	- This is something I still have a lot of room to improve with but closer to the end I realised how important time management is and realised how I should have been more serious about it at the start because I was working on the project when I had nothing else to do which often left it as something that was overlooked compared to my other subjects
- Report writing
	- Before this project I never wrote a report alone, but now I feel more confident about it and see how important writing a solid report is, as it's a very common thing in engineering, which is a career which I am looking into
- Project management
	- Since I was the only person working on my EPQ I was solely responsible for every aspect of it. I had to manage what I would do and make sure that I kept up to date with deadlines.
