# Time Planning

I started time planning and organisation early because I knew that I would regret it later if I didn't. Above you can see the Gantt chart which I was planning to use to set myself deadlines for each part of the project, but it was hard to predict since I had no prior experience in the skills which I was using for the majority of the project so it was hard top predict the amount of time it would take. So I didn't end up using that feature as much as I would like.

The graph is accurate to 1 day so that's why there are so many spikes on the graph as I wasn't working on the project on consecutive days most of the time.
Because of the way I recorded my logs (recording start and end time of each session) I was able to create this graph which shows all the hours accounted for in my logs, there were times where I didn't record the logs properly or was too lazy to record my progress so this graph isn't entirely accurate. But as of 13/09/2023 I have spent 76 accounted for hours on the project which doesn't seem like much since it was over the course of a year. This could be because I wasn't regularly spending time on the project, I was mostly working on the project whenever I felt like it rather than dedicating a piece of my week to the project on a regular basis. The only gap which I have an excuse for is the gap in January as another project which I was doing we coming to an end and I needed a lot more time to work on it. However for all the other gaps I have no excuse and should have spent more time on the project. This is definitely something that this project helped me realise and something I would like to improve upon in my next project.
