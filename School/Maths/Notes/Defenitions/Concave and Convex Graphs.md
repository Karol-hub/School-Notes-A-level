for a curve $y=f(x)$
if $f''(x)>0$ the gradient is increasing so the graph is convex
if $f''(x)<0$ the gradient is decreasing so the graph is concave

[[Point of Inflection]] is where the graph goes from being concave to convex or other way round
# Example
$$f(x)=x^{3}+x^{2}-x$$
find the interval where $f(x)$ is convex
$$f'(x)=3x^{2}+2x-1$$
$$f''(x)=6x+2$$
for $f(x)$ to be convex $f''(x)>0$
$$6x+2>0$$
$$x>-\frac{1}{3}$$
This [[Interval]] can be written as $(-\frac{1}{3},\infty)$
