Process of finding the gradient function
If we have the function
$$y=f(x)$$
Then the derivative is
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)$$
# Finding tangent and normal
- If we want to find equation tangent/normal at point $(a,b)$ on the curve $y=f(x)$
- We find gradient for tangent with $m=f'(a)$ then [[Perpendicular Lines|perpendicular]] for normal
- We have a point $(a,b)$ and the gradient $m$ so we can use [[Straight Line Equations]] to find the equation line
# Through first principle
$dx$ - tiniest possible change in x
$dy$ - tiniest possible change in y
# Example
$$y=x^2$$
$$y+dy = (x+dx)^{2}$$
$$dy=(x+dx)^{2}-x^2$$
$$dy = 2xdx + dx^2$$
All powers of $dx$ greater than 1 can be ignored since tiniest change squared will be infinitely small
$$dy = 2xdx$$
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=2x$$
