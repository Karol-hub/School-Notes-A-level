$>/<$ Has empty circle
$\geqslant/\leqslant$ Has filled circle
# Quadratic Inequalities
Solve then answer will be different
set notation:
$x \epsilon \mathbb{R}:-3<x<2$
or when the two sets aren't linked
$x \epsilon \mathbb{R}:-3>x \cup x>2$

$x \epsilon \mathbb{R}:-3>x>2$ wouldn't work because no number is greater than 2 but smaller than -3
