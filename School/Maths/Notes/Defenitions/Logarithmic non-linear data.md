If $y=ax^n$ 
```functionplot
---
xLabel: 
yLabel: 
bounds: [0,1,0,2]
disableZoom: false
grid: true
---
y=2x^3
```
start with
$$y=ax^{n}$$
take $log$ of both sides
$$\log y=log(ax^{n})$$
Using [[Log laws|multiplication law]]
$$\log =\log (x^{n})+log(a)$$
Using [[Log laws|power law]]
$$\log y= n\log (x)+log(a)$$
compare it to straight line equation
$$y=mx+c$$

| Symbol   | What it represents | What that means |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| $\log y$ | $y$                | y-axis          |
| $\log x$ | $x$                | x-axis          |
| $n$      | $m$                | gradient        |
| $\log a$ | $c$                | y-intercept     |
