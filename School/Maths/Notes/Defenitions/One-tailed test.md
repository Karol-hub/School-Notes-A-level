When the [[Null Hypothesis]] contains < or > 
- $H_0 : p > 0.25$
- $H_0 : p < 0.25$

To carry out a [[One-tailed test]] you need to:
- Formulate a model for the [[Test Statistic]]
- Identify a suitable [[Null Hypothesis]] and [[Alternate Hypothesis]]
- Calculate the probability of the [[Test Statistic]] talking the observed value (or higher/lower) assuming the [[Null Hypothesis]] is true
- Compare this to the significance level
- Write a conclusion in the context of the question
