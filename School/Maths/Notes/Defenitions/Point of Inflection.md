Is where the graph goes from being [[Concave and Convex Graphs|Concave to convex]] or other way round

for a curve $y=f(x)$
where $f''(x)=0$ and it has changed sign

Need to check $f''(x \pm dx)$ to make sure that that the sign has changed

# Example
Show that $(0,4)$ is a point of inflection on the graph of $$y=x^{5}-6x^{4}-\frac{16}{3}x^{3}+4$$
$$\frac{dy}{dx}=5x^{4}-24x^{3}-16x^{2}$$
$$\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=20x^{3}-72x^{2}-32x$$
At the point of inflection $$0=20x^{3}-72x^{2}-32x$$
when $x=0,y=4$
$$-0.1\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=20(-0.1)^{3}-72(-0.1)^{2}-32(-0.1)=\frac{123}{50}$$
$$0.1\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=20(0.1)^{3}-72(0.1)^{2}-32(0.1)=-\frac{39}{10}$$
at $(0,4)\, \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = 0$ and there is a change of sign either side of this point, therefore $(0,4)$ is a point of inflection
