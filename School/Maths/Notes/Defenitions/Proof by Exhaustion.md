- Split proof into smaller parts
- Prove smaller parts
# Example
$$x^{2}-x$$
Is always even
Split into two cases:
## Odd
$(2x+1), x \epsilon \mathbb{Z}$ is the [[Sets|set]] for all odd numbers
$$(2x+1)^{2}-(2x+1)$$
$$(2x+1)((2x+1)-(1))$$
$$(2x+1)(2x)$$
odd * even = even, so the statement is true
## Even
$$(2x)^{2}-2x$$
$$2x(2x-1)$$
even * odd = even, so the statement is true
