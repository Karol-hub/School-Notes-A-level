- Theorem
	- A statement that has been proven
- Mathematical statement/Conjecture
	- A statement that hasn't been proven

Use following steps:
1. Start with known facts or theorems
2. Clearly show logical steps
3. Arrive at statement that needs to be proven
# Identities
When both sides are the same
Use following steps:
- Start at one side
- Make logical steps that get you to the statement on the opposite side of the identity
# Methods of proof
- [[Proof by Exhaustion]]
- [[Proof by Counter-example]]
