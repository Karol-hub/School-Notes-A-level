# Linear Simultaneous Equations
Two unknowns and two equations linking the unknowns
get rid of one of the unknown then solve
## Example
1:$3x + 2y =5$     2: $5y+3x=8$
## Method 1
Solve for 1 unknown and substitute to find value of other
1:
$y=\frac{5-3x}{2}$
2:
$5(\frac{5-3x}{2}) + 3x = 8$
$\frac{25}{2} - \frac{15}{2}x +3x= 8$
$-\frac{9}{2}x = -\frac{9}{2}$
$x = 1$
then just solve for other
$y = \frac{5-3(1)}{2} = 1$
$x=1,y=1$
## Method 2
Add/subtract one equation from the other to get rid of one of the unknowns
$3x+2y=5$
$-(5y+3x)$ from left side and $-8$ from right side
$-3y = -3$
$y=1$
$3x+2(1)=5$
$x=1$
$x=1,y=1$
# Quadratic Simultaneous Equations
You solve just like Linear Simultaneous Equations mostly with method 1

```desmos-graph
y=x^2 -3x +2
y=-x+5
(-1,6)
(3,2)
```
$y=x^2 -3x +2$
$y=-x+5$
Where two lines intersect is the solution
