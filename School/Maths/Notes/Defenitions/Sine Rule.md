$$\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}$$
or 
$$\frac{\sin A}{a}=\frac{\sin B}{b}=\frac{\sin C}{c}$$
# Two solutions for sine
- Can sometimes produce two values for the angle
- If we have angle given angle $A$ and calculated angle $B$
	- If Given angle < Calculated Angle
	- if $A<B$
		- Then $B$ has an alternate solution
- [[Solutions to trig|Alternate solution]] for $B$
	-  $180-\sin B =B$  
# Example
$ABC$ is a triangle where $A =48°,a=4,b=5$
$$\frac{\sin 48°}{4}=\frac{\sin B}{5}$$
$$5(\frac{\sin 48°}{4})=\sin B$$
$$\arcsin 5(\frac{\sin 48°}{4})= B$$
$$B \approx 68.3°$$
In this case there are two solutions for B
![[example two solutions of sin.png]]
As seen on the right it's possible for B to be a different value
We know this because A + alternate B <180
$$B = 180-68.3=111.7°$$
$$ 111.7+48=159.7<180$$
So $B=111.7°$ is a viable solution
