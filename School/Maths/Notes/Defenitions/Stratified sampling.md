- The population is divided into mutually exclusive strata (Can only be part of one group) (eg males and females)
- [[Simple random sample]] is taken from each strata
- The proportion of each strata should be the same as the proportion for each strata in the population

$The \; number \; of \; people \; in \; a \; stratum = \frac{number \; in \; stratum}{number \; in \; population} * overall \; sample \; size$

| - [[Sample]] accurately reflects the [[Population]] structure </br> - Guarantees proportional representation of groups within the population | - Population must be clearly classified into distinct strata </br> - Selection within each stratum suffers from the same disadvantages as [[Simple random sample]]    |
