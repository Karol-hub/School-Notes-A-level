- [[Cosine Rule]]
- [[Sine Rule]]
- [[Area of Triangle]]
You need to know how to do [[Graph Transformations]] on trigonometric functions
# Sin
```desmos-graph
top=1.5; bottom = -1.5
---
y=\sin{x}
```
- loops every $2\pi$
# Cos
```desmos-graph
top=1.5; bottom = -1.5
---
y=\cos{x}
```
- loops every $2\pi$
# Tan
```desmos-graph
y=\tan{x}
```
- loops every $\pi$
