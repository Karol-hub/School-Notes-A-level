# Paper 1
- $+c$ when integrating
- Rounding error
- Show full workings, writing quadratic formula isn't enough
- $x^{2}+ y^{2}= r^{2}$ forgot its $r^{2}$ and just used r
- Didn't read question properly and got units wrong, gave in years needed months used years
- justify questions still weak
- Show that you can't take 2 out as factor when showing something is odd like $2(f(x)) + 1$
- Be careful with signs and make sure their correct
# Paper 2
- Used wrong angle need to be more careful
- when differentiating ignore $+c$
- oopsie doopsie when adding
- when differentiating you still ignore $+c$
- Wrong answer carried forward
- max happens at $\frac{\pi}{2}$ of sin not $\pi$
- Multiply everything in brackets by thing on outside
- ran out of time to finish Q
# Mechanics
- More precise with explain why questions
- Got a suvat Q wrong
- insufficient detail when explaining
- skipped a question by accident
# Stats
- Standard deviation wrong
- large data set
- Error when workings
- Critical region wrong
- Large data set wrong again, mixed with other Q
