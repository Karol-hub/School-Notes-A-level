- The point at which gravity appears to act
- When an object is uniform it's centre of gravity is at the centre
- When an object is irregular it's centre of gravity can be found by
	1. Attach the object and a plumb line (piece of string with a weight attached to it) to a clamp stand from the same point, so that the plumb line overlaps the object.
	2. Wait until the object is stable, then draw a line on the object where the plumbline lies.
	3. Repeat the above step at least 2 more times. The intersection point between all three lines is the centre of gravity
