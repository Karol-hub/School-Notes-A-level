Since the object's velocity is changing (even though the magnitude of the velocity is constant) we know that there must be some sort of force acting on the object to keep it in circular motion.
$$a = \frac{v^{2}}{r}=r \omega ^{2}$$

| Symbol | Unit | Definition |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $a$ | $ms^{-2}$ | Centripetal Acceleration |
| $v$ | $ms^{-1}$ | Linear [[Velocity]] |
| $r$ | $m$ | radius |
| $\omega$ | $rads^{-1}$ | [[Angular Velocity]] |
