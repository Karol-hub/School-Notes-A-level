Two types
- Elastic
	- [[Momentum]] and [[Kinetic Energy]] are conserved
- Inelastic
	- Only [[Momentum]] is conserved
	- [[Kinetic Energy]] is converted into other forms, and has changed

If the objects which collide stick together after the collision, then it's an inelastic collision
An explosion is an inelastic collision as the [[Kinetic Energy]] after an explosion is greater than before the explosion
# Conservation of momentum in 2D
- Momentum is always conserved in any interaction where no external forces act.
	- Momentum before = momentum after
- Important to note that momentum may be conserved differently along different dimensions

Consider
![[Collision in 2d|1000]]
To work out problems like this consider the horizontal and vertical momentum
- Horizontal momentum is preserved
- Vertical momentum is preserved
It can be considered as two separate systems

In this case horizontal momentum of $m_1$ and $m_2$ after the collision will be the same as the momentum of $m_1$ before the collision in both the horizontal and vertical axis
