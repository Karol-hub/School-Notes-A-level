- Distance
	- The distance travelled by an object
	- scalar quantity
- Displacement
	- The overall distance travelled from the starting position
	- vector quantity
- Speed
	- distance travelled per unit time
	- scalar quantity
- Velocity
	- rate of change of displacement
	- vector quantity
- Acceleration
	- rate of change of velocity
	- vector quantity

Uniform acceleration
- acceleration of an object is constant

Acceleration-time graphs
- area under the graph is the change in velocity
Velocity-time graphs
- gradient is acceleration
- area underneath is displacement
Displacement-time graphs
- gradient is velocity

Instantaneous velocity
- velocity of an object at a specific point in time
Average velocity
- velocity of an object over a specified time frame
