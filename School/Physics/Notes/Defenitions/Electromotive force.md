- The voltage being put into the circuit
Electromotive force (emf / $\varepsilon$) is the energy transferred by a cell per coulomb of charge that passes through it:
$$\varepsilon = \frac{E}{Q}$$

| Symbol | Unit | Definition |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $\varepsilon$ | $V$ | Electromotive force |
| $E$ | $J$ | [[Work done or Energy\|Energy]] |
| $Q$ | $C$ | [[Charge]] |
