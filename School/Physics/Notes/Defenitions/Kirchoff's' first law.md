aka. principle of [[Charge|charge]] conservation 
- Total [[Charge|electric charge]] in a closed system doesn't change
- The total [[Current]] flowing into a junction is equal to the total current flowing out of that junction
# Series Circuit
The [[Current]] is the same everywhere in the circuit

# Parallel Circuit
The sum of the [[Current|currents]] in each parallel set of branches is equal to the total current
