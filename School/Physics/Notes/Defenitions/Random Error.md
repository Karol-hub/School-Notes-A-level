- The unpredictable variation in a measurement. 
- These can be reduced by taking many repeated measurements and calculating their mean.

To reduce random errors:
- Take at least 3 repeats and calculate a mean
	- this method also allows anomalies to be identified.
- Use computers/data loggers/cameras to reduce human error and enable smaller intervals. 
- Use appropriate equipment, 
	- e.g. a micrometre has higher resolution (0.1 mm) than a ruler(1 mm)
