- A measure of how well a material conducts electricity
- Is also affected by temperature
$$\rho = \frac{RA}{l}$$

| Symbol | Unit       | Definition           |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| $\rho$ | $\Omega m$ | Resistivity          |
| $R$    | $\Omega$   | [[Resistance]]       |
| $A$    | $m^2$      | Cross Sectional Area |
| $l$    | $m$        | Wire Length          |

Equation can be rearranged to get
$$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$
# [[Voltage]] across a uniform wire
Resistance $\propto$ length
Can use equation for resistivity along with [[Ohm's Law|V=IR]] to find voltage across a uniform wire
