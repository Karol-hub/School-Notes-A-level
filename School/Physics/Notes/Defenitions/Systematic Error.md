- A consistent shift in readings causing a deviation from the true value. 
- This shift is due to the equipment or method being used
- Cannot be reduced by repeated measurements.

- Calibrate apparatus by measuring a known value (e.g. weigh 1 kg on a mass balance)
	- If the reading is inaccurate then the systematic error is easily identified. 
- In radiation experiments correct for background radiation by measuring it beforehand and excluding it from final results. 
- Read the meniscus (the central curve on the surface of a liquid) at eye level (to reduce parallax error)
- Use controls in experiments.
