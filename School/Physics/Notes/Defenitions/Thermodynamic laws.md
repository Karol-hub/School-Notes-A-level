- $0^{th}$ law
	- Objects in thermal contact are the same temperature
- $1^{st}$
	- Energy is conserved 
	- Energy can't be created or destroyed
	- Change in internal energy (U) of a system is equal to the heat energy (Q) transferred to it plus the [[Work done or Energy|work done]] (W) on it
	- $U = Q+W$
- $2^{nd}$
	- [[Entropy]] must increase
	- Thermal energy has to transfer to a colder object
- $3^{rd}$
	- An object cannot reach [[Absolute Zero]]
