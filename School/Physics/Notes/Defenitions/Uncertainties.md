- Bounds in which the accurate value can be expected to lie
- Can be represented in two ways
	- Absolute Uncertainty
		- uncertainty given as a fixed quantity
		- e.g. 7 ± 0.6 V
	- Percentage Uncertainty
		- uncertainty as a percentage of the measurement
		- e.g. 7 ± 8.6% V
- Uncertainties should be given to the same number of significant figures as the data
# Single Readings
Absolute Uncertainty:
$1/2 * resolution$ 

Percentage Uncertainty:
$(1/2*resolution)/value$

Exceptions:
- Ruler must include uncertainty for start position and end position so it would be x2
# Multiple Readings
Absolute Uncertainty:
$1/2 * range$

Percentage Uncertainty
$(1/2*range)/value$

# Combining Uncertainties
## Adding/Subtracting
- Add absolute uncertainties
- Add percentage uncertainties
## Multiplying/Dividing
- Add percentage uncertainties
## Raising to a power
- Multiply percentage uncertainty by power
