Describe magnitude and direction of a value
![[Vectors PQ example]]
Typically written as
- *a* - Bold
- $\underline{a}$ - Underlined: 
If $\overrightarrow{PQ}=a$ then $\overrightarrow{QP}=-a$
# Resolving Vectors
## Calculation
Use trigonometry to split a vector into it's horizontal and vertical components
if you have angle ($\theta$) with horizontal and vector V
$x = V \cos{\theta}$
$y = V\sin{\theta}$
### Magnitude
If you have horizontal and vertical components you can use [[Pythagorean theorem]] to find magnitude
### Direction
You can use trigonometry to find the angle
## Scale drawing
1. Start with appropriate scale
2. Using a ruler and protractor to draw the vector
	- Make sure vertical and horizontal components meet at right angle
3. Measure length of components and find value using scale 
# Adding Vectors
## Calculation
Use trigonometry to find the resultant vector

## Triangle example
![[Triangle vector example]]
If:
$$\overrightarrow{AB}=a$$
$$\overrightarrow{BC}=b$$
$$\overrightarrow{AC}=c$$
Then:
$$\overrightarrow{AB}+\overrightarrow{BC}=\overrightarrow{AC}$$
$$a+b=c$$
