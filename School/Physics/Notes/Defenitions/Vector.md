Describe magnitude and direction of a value
Typically written as
- *V* - Bold
- $\underline{V}$ - Underlined: 
# Resolving Vectors
## Calculation
Use trigonometry to split a vector into it's horizontal and vertical components
if you have angle ($\theta$) with horizontal and vector V
$x = V \cos{\theta}$
$y = V\sin{\theta}$
## Scale drawing
1. Start with appropriate scale
2. Using a ruler and protractor to draw the vector
	- Make sure vertical and horizontal components meet at right angle
3. Measure length of components and find value using scale
