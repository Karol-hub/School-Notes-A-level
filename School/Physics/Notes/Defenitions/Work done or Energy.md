$$W = F\Delta s$$

| Symbol | Unit | Definition                   |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------------------- |
| $W$    | $J$  | Work Done/Energy Transferred |
| $F$    | $N$  | [[Force]]                    |
| $\Delta s$       | $m$     | change in [[Displacement]] in the direction of motion |

[[Force]] doesn't act in the direction of motion so we use $F \cos{\theta}$ in the equation
