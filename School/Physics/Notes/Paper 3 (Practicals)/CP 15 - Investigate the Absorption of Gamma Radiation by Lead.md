- Sealed radioactive sources should be of a safe design and type suitable for school science.
- Sealed sources should be used whenever possible in preference to unsealed sources. Unsealed sources can only be justified when the scientific demonstrations would not be practicable using sealed sources.
- Records of all radioactive sources should be properly kept, showing what they are, when they were bought, when and by whom they have been used, and eventually, how they were disposed of.
- Radioactive sources should be used only when there is an educational benefit.
- Radioactive sources should be handled in ways that minimize both staff and student exposures.
- Sealed sources should be carefully checked periodically to make sure they remain in a safe condition.
- The school should have a suitable radioactivity detector in good working order.
- Young persons aged 16 and over may use radioactive sources under supervision.

| Radioactive source | Getting irradiated | - When not using a source, keep it in a lead-lined container </br>- When in use, try and keep a good distance (a metre or so) between yourself and the source </br>- When handling the source, do so using tweezers (or tongs) and point the source away from you </br>- Wash your hands and remove your outer layer of clothing after handling a radioactive source |

## Measuring Background radiation
1. Make sure that the radioactive source isn't within range of the GM tube
2. Measure counts over a 5min time frame and calculate the average per minute
## Measuring Gamma radiation
1. Measure thickness of lead sheets with Vernier calliper
	1. Measure across different points and find average
2. Place the radioactive source a fixed distance from the GM tube
3. Measure count rate over one minute
4. Repeat from 3 until you have 3 readings and take average
5. Place a sheet of lead between the source and GM tube and repeat from 3 until you have 3 readings for all lead thicknesses

## Error allowance
Max Gradient (green)
$$\left(\frac{-1.21-2.47}{56.32-0}\right) = -0.0653$$
Min Gradient (red)
$$\left(\frac{-0.66-1.52}{68.66-0.60}\right)= -0.0320$$
$$0.0320\leq \lambda \leq 0.0653$$
