## Error Analysis
Max Gradient (green)
$$\left(\frac{-1.21-2.47}{56.32-0}\right) = -0.0653$$
Min Gradient (red)
$$\left(\frac{-0.66-1.52}{68.66-0.60}\right)= -0.0320$$
$$0.0320\leq \lambda \leq 0.0653$$
## % Uncertainty
$$\text{\% diff} = \frac{\frac{0.0653-0.0320}{2}}{0.0443} * 100 = 37.6 \%$$
There is a significant % uncertainty in the value for $\lambda$ This could be because of the low Bq of the sample. Since if the sample activity would be higher, the effect of the random nature of radioactivity wouldn't be as significant.
# Questions
1. You are safer the further away you stand because the gamma rays will spread apart and they are less likely to hit you.
2. Radioactivity has a random nature so taking repeat readings will allow us to find the average which will be more accurate than one reading.
3. Using a data logger would improve the results as it would be easier to take more readings over a larger period of time, making the value more accurate.
